# Movies-DB
This is a file on how to run my code in the OS1 engr server using the GCC compiler.

There are 3 steps.
1. Input this command "gcc -std=c99 -o movies main.c" and press enter
2. Then "./movies movies_sample_1.csv" and press enter (you can change movies_sample_1.csv for whatever csv movie file you want as long as it is structured the same)
3. Enjoy!
